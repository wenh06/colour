# There are three different functions here: film_intensity, filmColourSpec, filmColour.
#
# film_intensity takes in the thickness of a film (in nm), the wavelength of some light incident on that film (in nm), a boolean which tells it whether or not the film is made of water because if it is, it can use an empirical algorithm to determine the refractive index for
# that wavelength from the water's absolute temperature (in K) and its density (in kg/m^3). There is also the option to make "water=False" and then "n=2.4" or any other manually inserted refractive index if the liquid in question is, say, oil. The function then outputs
# a "relative intensity" of the light that will come off the film (taking into account the interference with its own partial reflections). This intensity will ALWAYS be in the range [0,1].
#
# filmColour then takes in the same information (in the same units) but not wavelength and assumes a white-light uniform source - you may be able to add in functionality for using illuminants but I haven't read anything about how that stuff works in your library. It then
# outputs to the user's screen a plotted ColourSwatch with the colour you would see reflected from the film in that situation.
#
# filmColourSpec takes in the same information as filmColour but instead of a single thickness, you give it a range of thicknesses in the form of thick_min and thick_max. It then plots a graph for you of how the spectrum of colours reflected varies with different
# thicknesses with a title.
#
# Most of these things have helpful defaults built-in so you can try them straight out of the box to see what I mean! Good luck, thanks again for your help and don't be afraid to ask me for any explanation (or to completely change every part of my code)! I'm honoured
# that anyone would want it!
